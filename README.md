👋 Hey, I'm Jacques, aka @jacquesdv99! Back-end development is where I thrive, and for me, code is like a canvas – each line a brushstroke in the masterpiece.

🌱 Currently cruising through my second year of software studies, diving deep into the world of back-end magic.

💞️ I'm all about teaming up on cool projects where I can lend a hand and learn something new. Drop me a line at devilliersjacques4@gmail.com; I'm always up for a chat!

⛳ When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me on the golf course, chasing that elusive hole-in-one. And when I'm not there, I'm kicking back with friends, cheering on our favorite teams in any sport under the sun. Let's team up and make some coding dreams a reality!
